# API Gateway for Panchang and Hindu Festival Data

Welcome to the API Gateway for accessing Panchang (Hindu calendar) and Hindu festival data. 
This project is under active development and aims to provide secure and efficient public access to the core Panchang API used by the QuickPanchang macOS app.

Check out the project development plan [here](https://aatmamartya.notion.site/8baed2e3ef3143a694025b0fd7ee1d3b?v=08bc8730f77d4627a2bad9378dcd0f73&pvs=74) to get updates on the project's development.

## Project Description

This project is an API gateway built using Go (Golang) following a microservices architecture. The main components include:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**: System with email verification to ensure secure access.
2. **API Key Management**: Enables users to generate and manage API keys for accessing Panchang and festival data.
3. **Rate Limiting and Request Tracking**: Monitors and controls API usage to prevent abuse.
4. **Caching Mechanism**: Optimizes data retrieval for better performance.
5. **Proxy Functionality**: Forwards authenticated requests to the existing core Panchang API.

### Key Features

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL for storing user information, API keys, and usage analytics.
- **Temporary Data Storage**: Utilizes Redis for OTPs, session data, and caching.
- **Containerization**: Dockerized setup for easy deployment and orchestration with Docker Compose.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Incorporates password hashing, API key generation, and protection against fraudulent signups.

### Endpoints

- **User Registration**: Allows new users to register.
- **Email Verification**: Confirms user registration via email.
- **Data Retrieval**: Provides Panchang and Hindu festival information.
- **Usage Statistics**: Tracks API usage and provides analytics.
